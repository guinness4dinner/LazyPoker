-Issues:
	-No Sidepot text.
	-Sidepot- round doesn't end cause sidepot player isn't called. 	Both fixed but not tested.


-Multiple Sidepot Logic... (check that the single side pot works first)
Test:
-Sidepots

Then:
-Player naming
-Player Disconnection
	-Set them as eliminated instead of deleting the player object.
	-If they reconnect, can they take thier seat back?
-Server-side in-game options:	
	-Force New Round. (What happens to pot? Just throw it away).
